# Production Deployment Guide

## Build Output

Your production build has been created in the `dist/` folder with the following structure:

```
dist/
├── index.js          # Express server bundle
├── package.json      # Production dependencies
└── public/           # Static assets
    ├── index.html    # Main HTML file
    └── assets/       # CSS and JS bundles
        ├── index-CHCn6LcQ.js   # Main JavaScript bundle (668KB)
        └── index-CJOxpnLc.css  # Styles bundle (124KB)
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files
Upload the entire `dist/` folder to your domain's root directory or a subdirectory.

### 2. Install Dependencies
On your server, navigate to the uploaded folder and run:
```bash
npm install --production
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables on your server:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (if using a database)
- `SESSION_SECRET` (for session management)
- Any other environment variables your app requires

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

Or use a process manager like PM2:
```bash
pm2 start index.js --name "your-app-name"
```

## Server Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 18+ (supports ES modules)
- **Port**: The app will run on the port specified by `process.env.PORT` or default to 3000
- **Database**: Configure your database connection string if using a database

## Static File Serving

The Express server serves static files from the `public/` directory. Your domain should point to the server running on the configured port.

## Production Optimizations Applied

✅ Minified JavaScript and CSS
✅ Gzipped assets (183KB JS, 16KB CSS)
✅ Production-only dependencies
✅ ES modules for better tree-shaking
✅ Bundled server code

## Notes

- The JavaScript bundle is 668KB minified. Consider code-splitting for further optimization if needed.
- All client-side routing is handled by the React app
- The Express server handles API routes and serves the React app

## Download the Build

You can now download the `dist/` folder and upload it to your hosting provider.
